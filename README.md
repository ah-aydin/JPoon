# JPoon

Inspired by the [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) plugin made for neovim, this plugin
helps to navigate between a set of selected files (up to 9) by utilizing keyboard shortcuts.

### Usage

- Add the focused file to the list (Alt+W default keybinding)
- Default keybindings for navigation
    - Alt+a switch to the first file
    - Alt+s switch to the second file
    - Alt+d switch to the third file
    - And so on
- Edit JPoon files list (Alt+E default keybinding)
    - ``J`` ``K`` to move up and down
    - ``Shift+J`` ``Shift+K`` to move the selected file location up and down
    - Double click ``D`` to remove file from list
    - ``Enter`` to save changes ``Esc`` to discard
